# Surfs Up with Advance Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview
This analysis is to provide an insight for an investor to determine the stability of opening an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii.

With the weather data provided the precipitation, temperatures and number of stations were all analyzed to help future investors get a deeper understanding on whether their investments would be worthwhile.  In addition, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu were extracted from the date column in the weather data for further analysis to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business was sustainable year round.
